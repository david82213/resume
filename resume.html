<!-- Demonstrate your ability to create a resume using HTML.
Your design should provide at least one example of each of the
following:
- an ordered and unordered list
- use of paragraph, horizontal rule and break tags
- use of character formatting (such as heading levels,
bold and italic)
- and images (perhaps a photo of yourself, background image,
custom rule, or other simple decoration)

The page should follow the standard design of a work resume.
If you are uncomfortable putting personal information,
feel free to make up content.
We're more concerned with your ability to use and
understand the various markup tags. -->
